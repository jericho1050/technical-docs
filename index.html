            <p>To start developing with Three.js, you should make sure you are using a modern browser with good <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API" target="_blank">WebGL</a>
                support, such as the latest Firefox or Chrome.

                You can download the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/master.zip" class="external"
                    target="_blank">latest Three.js library</a> and copy the minified version of Three.js from the
                uncompressed archive at <code class="snippet">build/three.module.min.js </code>into your project. Bear
                in mind
                that the
                archives
                include source files, which makes the download size approximately 350MB.

                Alternatively, you can import Three.js using a CDN or use Node.js. A Node.js setup with Three.js
                installed as a dependency is convenient if you want to track versions and it can speed up collaboration
                and deployment:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    npm install --save three
                    npm install --save-dev vite # For development
                    npx vite
                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>Whichever way you choose to get started, make sure you have the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/"
                    class="external" target="_blank">Three.js documentation</a> open somewhere while you're working for
                reference.</p>

            <header>Renderer</header>
            <p>A renderer is a tool which displays scenes right in your browser. There are a few different renderers:
                WebGL is the default, and others you can use are Canvas, SVG, CSS, and DOM. They differ in how
                everything is rendered, so the WebGL implementation will implement differently than the CSS one. Despite
                the variety of ways they achieve the goal, the experience will look the same for the user. Thanks to
                this approach, a fallback can be used, if a desired technology is not supported by the browser.</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
                    renderer.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);
                    renderer.setClearColor(0xdddddd, 1);
                    document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                We are creating a new WebGL renderer, setting its size to fit the whole available space on the screen,
                and appending the DOM structure to the page. You might have noticed the antialias parameter in the first
                line — this renders the edges of shapes more smoothly. The <code class="snippet">setClearColor()</code>
                method sets our
                background to
                a light gray color, instead of the default black one.
            </p>

                Add this code into our second <code class="snippet">&lt;script&gt;</code> element, just below the

            <header>Scene</header>
            <p>A scene is the place where everything happens. When creating new objects in the demo, we add them all
                inside the scene to become visible on the screen. In three.js, the scene is represented by a Scene
                object. Let's create it, by adding the following line below our previous lines:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const scene = new THREE.Scene();
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Later, we will be using the <code class="snippet">.add()</code> method, to add objects to this scene.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section id="Camera" class="main-section">
            <header>Camera</header>
            <p>We have the rendered scene, but we still need to add a camera to view our handiwork imagine a movie set
                without any cameras. The following lines put the camera in place in the 3D coordinate system, and point
                it in the direction of our scene, so we can finally see something:</p>
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, WIDTH / HEIGHT);
                        camera.position.z = 50;
                        scene.add(camera);

                    </code>
                </pre>
            <p>
                Add the above lines to your code, below those previously added.
            </p>
            <p>There are other types of camera available (Cube, Orthographic), but the simplest is Perspective. To
                initialize it, we have to set its field of view and aspect ratio: the former is used to set how much is
                seen, and the latter is important for the objects on the screen to have the right proportions when
                rendered, and not look stretched. Let's explain values we are setting for the code above:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The value we set for the field of view, 70, is something we can experiment with: the higher the
                    value, the greater the amount of scene the camera will show. Imagine a normal camera view, versus a
                    fish eye effect, which allows a lot more to be seen. The default value is 50.</li>
                <li>The aspect ratio is set to the current width and height of the window so it will be dynamically
                    adjusted. We could set a fixed ratio — for example 16 ⁄ 9, which is the aspect ratio of a widescreen
                    TV. The default value is 1.</li>
                <li>The z position, with the value of 50 units, is the distance between the camera and the center of the
                    scene on the z axis. Here we're moving the camera back, so the objects in the scene can be viewed.
                    50 feels about right. It's not too near, or too far, and the sizes of the objects allow them to stay
                    on the scene, within the given field of view. The x and y values, if not specified, will default to
                    0.</li>
                <li>Lighting is crucial in a 3D scene to ensure objects are visible and have depth. Directional light,
                    point light, and ambient light are common types. Each affects the scene in different ways, providing
                    a range of lighting effects.</li>
                <li>Materials define the appearance of objects in the scene. They can be simple colors, textures, or
                    more complex shaders that interact with light in different ways. Choosing the right material can
                    greatly enhance the realism or stylization of the scene.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You should experiment with these values and see how they change what you see in the scene
            </p>
            <ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>
                    Note: The distance values (e.g. for the camera z position) are unitless, and can be anything you
                    deem suitable for your scene: millimeters, meters, feet, or miles. It's up to you.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <header>Rendering the scene</header>
            <p>Everything is ready, but we still can't see anything. Although we've set up the renderer, we still need
                to render everything. Our <code class="snippet">render() </code>function will do this job, with a little
                help from
                <code class="snippet">requestAnimationFrame()</code>, which causes the scene to be re-rendered
                constantly on every frame:

            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    function render() {
                        requestAnimationFrame(render);
                        renderer.render(scene, camera);
                      }
                      render();
                      
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                On every new frame the <code class="snippet">render</code> function is invoked, and the <code
                    class="snippet">renderer</code> renders the scene and the camera.
                Right after the function declaration, we're invoking it for the first time to start the loop, after
                which it will be used indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Again, add this new code below your previous additions. Try saving the file and opening it in your
                browser. You should now see a gray window. Congratulations!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Geometry" class="main-section">
            <header>Geometry</header>
            <p>Now our scene is properly rendering, we can start adding 3D shapes. To speed up development, Three.js
                provides a bunch of predefined primitives, which you can use to create shapes instantly in a single line
                of code. There's cubes, spheres, cylinders, and more complicated shapes available. Detail like drawing
                required vertices and faces, for a given shape, is handled by the Three framework, so we can focus on
                higher level coding. Let's start, by defining the geometry for a cube shape, adding the following just
                above the <code class="snippet">render()</code> function:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 10);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In this case, we define a simple cube that is 10 x 10 x 10 units. The geometry itself is not enough
                though, we also need a material that will be used for our shape.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Material" class="main-section">
            <header>Material</header>
            <p>A material is what covers an object, the colors, or textures on its surface. In our case, we will choose
                a simple blue color to paint our box. There are a number of predefined materials which can be used:
                Basic, Phong, Lambert. Let's play with the last two later, but for now, the Basic one should be enough:ƒ
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const basicMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0095dd });

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Add this line below the previously added.<br /><br />
                Our material is now ready, what next?
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Mesh" class="main-section">
            <header>Mesh</header>
            <p>To apply the material to a geometry, a mesh is used. This takes on a shape, and adds the specified
                material to every face:</p>
            <p>
                Again, add this line below the one you previously added.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Adding_the_cube_to_the_scene" class="main-section">
            <header>Adding the cube to the scene</header>
            <p>We've now created a cube, using the geometry and material defined earlier. The last thing to do is to
                place the cube to our scene. Add this line below the previous one:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    scene.add(cube);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                If you save, and refresh your Web browser, our object will now look like a square, because it's facing
                the camera. The good thing about objects, is that we can move them on the scene, however we want. For
                example, rotating and scaling as we like. Let's apply a little rotation to the cube, so we can see more
                than one face. Again, adding our code below the previous:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    cube.rotation.set(0.4, 0.2, 0);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Congratulations, you've created an object in a 3D environment! This might have proven easier than you
                first thought? Here's how it should look:
            </p>
            <img

            <p>
                And here's the code we have created so far:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, WIDTH/HEIGHT);
                    camera.position.z = 50;
                    scene.add(camera);

                    var boxGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 10);
                    var basicMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x0095DD});
                    var cube = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, basicMaterial);
                    scene.add(cube);
                    cube.rotation.set(0.4, 0.2, 0);

                    function render() {
                        requestAnimationFrame(render);
                        renderer.render(scene, camera);
                    }
                    render();
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
            <p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/end3r/MDN-Games-3D/blob/gh-pages/Three.js/cube.html"
                    class="external" target="_blank">check it out on GitHub</a>.</p>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="More_shapes_and_materials" class="main-section">
            <header>More shapes and materials</header>
            <p>Now we will add more shapes to the scene, and explore other shapes, materials, lighting, and more. Let's
                move the cube to the left, to make space for some friends. Adding the following line just below the
                previous one:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    cube.position.x = -25;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Now onto more shapes and materials. What might happen when you add a torus, wrapped in the Phong
                material? Try adding the following lines, just below the lines defining the cube.
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const torusGeometry = new THREE.TorusGeometry(7, 1, 6, 12);
                    const phongMaterial = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ color: 0xff9500 });
                    const torus = new THREE.Mesh(torusGeometry, phongMaterial);
                    scene.add(torus);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                These lines will add a torus geometry; the TorusGeometry() method's parameters define, and the
                parameters are radius, tube diameter, radial segment count, and tubular segment count. The Phong
                material should look more glossy than the box's simple Basic material, though right now our torus will
                just look black.
                <br><br><br>
                We can choose more fun predefined shapes. Let's play some more. Add the following lines, below those
                defining the torus:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const dodecahedronGeometry = new THREE.DodecahedronGeometry(7);
                    const lambertMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0xeaeff2 });
                    const dodecahedron = new THREE.Mesh(dodecahedronGeometry, lambertMaterial);
                    dodecahedron.position.x = 25;
                    scene.add(dodecahedron);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                This time, we are creating a dodecahedron, a shape containing twelve flat faces. The parameter,
                <code class="snippet">DodecahedronGeometry()</code>, defines the size of the object. We're using a
                Lambert material, similar to
                Phong, but should be less glossy. Again it's black, for now. We're moving the object to the right, so
                it's not in the same position as the box, or torus.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, the new objects currently just look black. To have both, the Phong and Lambert
                materials properly visible, we need to introduce a source of light.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Lights" class="main-section">
            <header>Lights</header>
            <p>There are various types of light sources available in Three.js. The most basic is <code
                    class="snippet">PointLight</code>, which works
                like a flashlight, shining a spotlight in a defined direction. Add the following lines, below your shape
                definitions:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    const light = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff);
                    light.position.set(-10, 15, 50);
                    scene.add(light);

                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                We define a white point of light, set its position a little away from the center of the scene, so it can
                light up some parts of the shapes, finally adding it to the scene. Now everything works as it should,
                all three shapes are visible. You should check the documentation for other types of lights, like
                Ambient, Directional, Hemisphere, or Spot. Experiment placing them on our scene, to see how they affect
                it.
            </p>

            <p>
                This looks a little boring though. In a game, something is usually happening. We might see animations
                and such. So let's try breathing a little life into these shapes, by animating them!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Animation" class="main-section">
            <header>Animation</header>
            <p>We already used rotation, to adjust the position of the cube. We can also scale the shapes, or change
                their positions. To show animation, we need to make changes to these values inside the render loop, so
                they update on each frame.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="Rotation" class="main-section">
            <header>Rotation</header>
            <p>Rotating is straightforward. You add a value to a given direction of rotation on each frame. Add this
                line of code, right after the requestAnimationFrame() invocation inside the render function:
            </p>
            <code>
                cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
            </code>
            <p>
                This rotates the cube on every frame, by a tiny bit, so the animation looks smooth.


            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Scaling" class="main-section">
            <header>Scaling</header>
            <p>We can also scale an object. Applying a constant value, we would make it grow, or shrink just once. Let's
                make things more interesting. First, we implement a helper variable, called <code
                    class="snippet">t</code> for counting elapsed
                time. Add it right before the <code class="snippet">render()</code> function:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    let t = 0;
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                Now let's increase the value by a given constant value, on each frame of the animation. Add the
                following lines, just below the requestAnimationFrame() invocation:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    t += 0.01;
                    torus.scale.y = Math.abs(Math.sin(t));
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                We use <code class="snippet">Math.sin</code>, ending up with quite an interesting result. This scales
                the torus, repeating the
                process, as <code class="snippet">sin</code> is a periodic function. We're wrapping the scale value in
                <code class="snippet">Math.abs</code>, to pass the absolute
                values, greater or equal to 0. As sin is between -1 and 1, negative values might render out torus in
                unexpected way. In this case it looks black half the time.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Moving" class="main-section">
            <header>Moving</header>
            <p>Aside from rotation, and scaling, we can additionally move objects around the scene. Add the following,
                again just below our requestAnimationFrame() invocation:</p>
            <code>
                    dodecahedron.position.y = -7 * Math.sin(t * 2);
                </code>
            <p>
                This will move the dodecahedron up and down, by applying the sin() value to the y-axis on each frame,
                and a little adjustment to make it look cooler. Try changing these values, to see how it affects the
                animations.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="Conclusion" class="main-section">
            <header>Conclusion</header>
            <p>Here's the final code:
